## Background

Personally, I enjoy using Strong very much as it allows me to focus on lifts and not worry about how much rest I need to take or writing everything down.

*However*, one thing that is locked behind a paywall is progression statistics. Thankfully, Strong lets you export your user data as a CSV file. StrongStats lets you take that CSV, upload it, and view your progression statistics.
